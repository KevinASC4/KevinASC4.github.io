I had the incredible opportunity to be featured in *The New York Times* article, ["24, and Trying to Outrun Schizophrenia"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/health/schizophrenia-early-intervention-treatment.html). The article highlights the immense challenges that individuals with schizophrenia faceâ€”challenges that often make it difficult to maintain stability, pursue education, or achieve career goals. Schizophrenia is a condition that affects cognition, perception, and emotional regulation, and for many, it can be a barrier to leading an independent life. The statistics paint a harsh reality: many who are diagnosed struggle with employment, education, and personal well-being.  

Despite these challenges, I refuse to let schizophrenia define my future. Instead of becoming a statistic, I am pushing forward, proving that with perseverance, the right support system, and a relentless drive, it is possible to defy the odds. My passion for **computer science, data analytics, and machine learning** has driven me to excel academically and professionally. From earning my degree at **Syracuse University** to pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University**, I am continuously working toward breaking barriers in the tech industry.  

Mental health conditions like schizophrenia often come with societal stigma, misconceptions, and underrepresentation in fields like **STEM**. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others facing similar challenges to recognize their own potential, seek the support they need, and pursue their dreams unapologetically. My story is not just about overcoming adversityâ€”itâ€™s about reshaping narratives, challenging expectations, and proving that success is possible no matter the obstacles.
