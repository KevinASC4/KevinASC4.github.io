    "text": "I had the incredible opportunity to be featured in The New York Times article, “24, and Trying to Outrun Schizophrenia”. The article highlights the immense challenges that individuals with schizophrenia face—challenges that often make it difficult to maintain stability, pursue education, or achieve career goals. Schizophrenia is a condition that affects cognition, perception, and emotional regulation, and for many, it can be a barrier to leading an independent life. The statistics paint a harsh reality: many who are diagnosed struggle with employment, education, and personal well-being.\nDespite these challenges, I refuse to let schizophrenia define my future. Instead of becoming a statistic, I am pushing forward, proving that with perseverance, the right support system, and a relentless drive, it is possible to defy the odds. My passion for computer science, data analytics, and machine learning has driven me to excel academically and professionally. From earning my degree at Syracuse University to pursuing my Master’s in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University, I am continuously working toward breaking barriers in the tech industry.\nMental health conditions like schizophrenia often come with societal stigma, misconceptions, and underrepresentation in fields like STEM. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others facing similar challenges to recognize their own potential, seek the support they need, and pursue their dreams unapologetically. My story is not just about overcoming adversity—it’s about reshaping narratives, challenging expectations, and proving that success is possible no matter the obstacles."

    "text": "Welcome to my Boston University coursework page. Below, you’ll find a list of courses I’ve taken, along with code execution from my assignments and projects. I have utilized a majority of R and python for my courses. All files can be found on my Github repository linked below\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this course is to equip students with the mathematical and practical skills necessary for success in the field of data analytics. Throughout the course, we reviewed essential concepts in probability and statistics while gaining hands-on experience with the R programming language for statistical computing and graphics. We explored various types of data and delved into data summarization techniques, including visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.\nLearning about histograms was particularly impactful for my understanding of data analysis. Histograms provided a powerful way to visualize the distribution of continuous data, allowing me to identify patterns, trends, and outliers within datasets. By representing data in this manner, I gained insights into the underlying structure of the data, which is crucial for effective decision-making.\nIn addition to histograms, the course covered the analysis of discrete, continuous, and multivariate distributions, enabling me to grasp how different data populations behave. We also examined common errors in measurements and computations, which emphasized the importance of accuracy in data analysis. Topics such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing were integral to the curriculum, as they formed the basis for making data-driven conclusions.\nBy the end of the course, I not only gained proficiency in R for data visualization and analysis but also developed a solid foundation in the statistical concepts that underpin effective data analytics. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application has significantly enhanced my analytical skills, preparing me for more advanced studies and real-world data challenges. An example of what I was doing can be found below.\n\n\n\n# Run the external R script using the raw GitHub URL\nscript_url &lt;- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinASC4/BostonUniversityCS/main/CS544-BU/hw10.R'\noutput &lt;- source(script_url, echo = FALSE)\n\n# Print output to ensure it's shown\nprint(output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy working through various algorithmic challenges, I gained a deep understanding of how different algorithms operate and their efficiencies. Learning about dynamic programming and greedy algorithms was particularly valuable, as it equipped me with the techniques to solve complex problems optimally. Implementing algorithms in programming assignments reinforced my coding skills and helped me appreciate the importance of algorithmic efficiency in software development.\nOverall, this course significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and provided me with a solid foundation for future studies in computer science and data analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the CS677 - Data Science with Python course, students learn major Python tools and techniques for data analysis. The course covers various topics through weekly assignments and mini-projects, allowing students to build essential statistical, visualization, and data science skills necessary for effective data usage in diverse applications, including finance, text processing, time series analysis, and recommendation systems.\nA significant focus of the course is on basic machine learning techniques, such as linear regression. Understanding linear regression was particularly beneficial as it provided insights into how to model relationships between variables and make predictions based on data. Through practical implementations and visualizations, I learned how to evaluate model performance and apply these techniques to real-world datasets.\nAdditionally, students are required to choose a topic for a final project, which they present on the last day of class. This project allows for the application of learned skills to a comprehensive data analysis problem, enhancing both technical abilities and presentation skills. In the below scripts I had to recreate the graphs provided using seaborn,matplot.lib, numpy and pandas.\n\nimport requests\nimport nbformat\nfrom nbclient import NotebookClient\n\n# GitHub raw URL of the Jupyter Notebook\nnotebook_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinASC4/BostonUniversityCS/main/CS677-BU/files_for_HW3_Seaborn/files_for_HW3_Seaborn/files_for_HW3/HW3_Seaborn.ipynb\"\n\n# Fetch notebook\nresponse = requests.get(notebook_url)\n#if response.status_code == 200:\n #   notebook_content = response.text\n #   nb_node = nbformat.reads(notebook_content, as_version=4)\n\n    # Execute the notebook\n  #  client = NotebookClient(nb_node)\n   # client.execute()\n\n    # Display executed notebook content\n   # print(nbformat.writes(nb_node, version=4))\n#else:\n#    print(\"Error: Unable to download notebook!\")"
