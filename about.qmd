# About Me  

Hello! I'm **Kevin Lopez**, a **Computer Science** graduate from **Syracuse University** and a current **Applied Data Analytics** master's student at **Boston University**. I specialize in **data science, software engineering, and machine learning**.  

My journey into the world of coding began in **2018** when I participated in the **All Star Code** program. This coding bootcamp was instrumental in shaping my passion for technology and programming. Through rigorous training, mentorship, and hands-on projects, I gained foundational skills in software development that sparked my interest in pursuing a career in tech. The experience not only equipped me with essential programming languages like Python and JavaScript but also taught me the importance of collaboration and problem-solving in a team environment. You can see the projects related to this in my github with OATH and Firebase. I also had my introduction to APIs during this time as well.

As a result of my experience with All Star Code, I incorporated **ASC4** into my GitHub username, representing my affiliation with **Cohort 4** of the program in the Cisco Offices near Madison Square Garden. Them being my introduction to Github has provided me with this time capsule encapsulating my beginnings to programming. This identifier serves as a reminder of the pivotal role the bootcamp played in my journey and my commitment to continuing growth in the tech field. You can check out the coding bootcamp and learn more about their mission [here](https://allstarcode.org).

I have a passion for working on **AI, full-stack development, and data-driven solutions**. Here, you can learn more about my background, education, and experiences.

## ‚öΩ Hobbies  

### ‚öΩ Soccer: The Beautiful Game  
Soccer has been more than just a sport for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a passion that has shaped my teamwork, strategic thinking, and perseverance. Whether I‚Äôm on the field playing as a midfielder(Very rare nowadays) or watching the World Cup Qualifiers, I love the fluidity and tactical depth of the game. I enjoy analyzing team formations, player movement, and the psychology behind decision-making under pressure.  

Beyond just playing, I also like keeping up with soccer analytics, exploring how data science is used to evaluate player performance, predict match outcomes, and optimize team strategies. The intersection of **sports and technology** fascinates me, and I often explore statistical models used in player scouting and game predictions.

### ‚ôüÔ∏è Game Theory & Strategic Thinking  
Game theory is an area where my interest in logic, mathematics, and decision-making come together. I enjoy learning about **optimal strategies, Nash equilibrium, and probability models**‚Äînot just in games, but in real-world applications like economics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.  

One of my favorite ways to apply game theory is through **Card Games, like blackjack, and AI-driven simulations**. I like breaking down strategic interactions, whether it‚Äôs finding the best move in a hand or analyzing how companies compete in a pricing war using **Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma** concepts.  

Additionally, I‚Äôve explored the use of **machine learning in game strategy**, particularly reinforcement learning algorithms that teach AI how to make smarter decisions over time. This area closely relates to AI-driven competition, like training bots to play games such as Dota 2, Starcraft, and Go.
